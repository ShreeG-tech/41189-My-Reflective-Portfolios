# My 41189 Reflective Portfolio

# Week 3

## What have I learnt this week?
This week I learnt how models shape the way that people behave in various situations-these include rational, behavioural and rule-based. I also learnt how people decide, conceal or reveal information, how they add value and power, as well as how people solve issues in groups. 

## What do I 'now know' that I did not before?
This week’s learning’s have really surprised me in terms of how people operate in general. But I do know that quite a lot of decisions come with multi-criterions such as buying a house as you need to decide your borrowing limit, location, type of house style etc.  Even higher education can come with multi criterions. It can create decision fatigue or cognitive dissonance. Another thing I now know is that modelling looks at decision making for 2 reasons: normative which enables us to make better decisions, or positive in order to find out why people make the decisions that they do. 

## What insights have I gained?
The insights I gained from this week’s content are that through changing the way we view the problem, then we can arrive at optimal solutions. Diverse perspective + diverse heuristics leads to teams obtaining better solutions. And then recombination comes to present them in novel ways. *Perspectives → Heuristics → Team diversity → Recombination = Innovation*. Furthermore, decision trees are used when you don’t know the odds I uncertain situations. They’re a makeshift tool when you don’t have actual certainties or probabilities to be working with. 

## What are (my/the) perceived strengths and weaknesses that I have observed?
For me, my perceived strengths are that I am excited to meet new people and learn along with them, but my perceived weaknesses are that I’m a bit socially awkward and don’t know how to deal with people in some situations, as I believe I’d do something wrong in terms of not creating a good impression. 

## What were the challenges I encountered/observed and how well (did I/my team) handle them?
The challenges I observed this week are that people are complex in the way they operate themselves in various situations-it can be hard to keep up with them. Everyone has different perspectives, and thus ways of getting things done or arriving at a particular conclusion. They can be handled by actively listening to what each member has to say, and accepting that not everyone’s thoughts would always run in tandem with each other. Everything needs to be done for the good of the team. 

## What would I do better next time and with what anticipated results?
I would learn to delve deeper into how people’s thought processes work whenever they make a decision among the alternatives surrounding them. I would also adjust my unrealistic expectations so that I see them for what they’re capable of doing at the moment, nothing more and nothing less. I would learn to give them the benefit of the doubt. 

## What theory proved to be useful and why? What have I learnt from this?
The theory I feel that has proved to be most useful for this week is that signalling models are used for when people are identifying the conditions under which they send out costly signals in order to reveal information or their type.  The aim is to make these signals less costly by providing them with functionality so as to reduce the persistence of wasteful signalling.
